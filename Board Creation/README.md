# PRTF-30: Create Agile Board

## Steps
- I created a new project with the following settings:
    - Scrum template
    - Company-managed project
    - An appropriate name (Portfolio Refresh)
    - A distinct key (PRTF)
    - No teammates (solo project)
- Then I configured the project to my liking
    - Make myself Default Assignee
    - Add status of "Integrating" to capture the step of publishing my work to a resume or repo
    - Add column to Scrum board for "Integrating" status
    - Changed the project icon
